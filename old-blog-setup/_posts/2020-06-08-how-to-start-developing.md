I am sure that it is just not me who feel like throwing up every time I look at one of those lists that map out everything you need to know about frontend development. The only thing I can say about such a list is “what a sh*t fest”. How the hell is it that we are supposed to learn all this stuff? There are just too many things you could be doing and who have the time to do them all? I’ll be honest, in the past I have quit many things (including programming) looking at a list like that. 

So how do not feel like throwing up when looking at these charts? Well first, stop looking at them! Bam, anxiety gone. But seriously, you will not learn every single thing that is on that list, you may not even learn half of the things that is on the list ever. Stop thinking that you need to master everything because you can’t, it is better to master a few things very well than just simply knowing a little bit of everything. In this situation, always remember the 80/20 rule – most of the time 80% of what produce results can be found in 20% of the content.
Still feel overwhelmed with all the options? Well, below I have outlined a framework that you can follow to help with that feeling.

1)	Do your research 
Read, watch, consume everything that you want to learn about. Go to google, go to YouTube, go to blog posts, read about it. In the case of web dev, search up roadmaps to see what your options are. Then search up about all the technologies that are associated with web development – frameworks, tools, etc. At this point you don’t have to start on learning anything specific yet. Get a brief wide view of the field and what is available out there.

2)	Decide 
After you have done a thorough research, decide on a single path that you want to take based on your research – this may be hard because you simply don’t know what you don’t know – my advice in this case is to just pick something you seem to have an interest in over everything else – no point in lamenting about something that you have no basis to decide upon. In my case, I think that front end development is going to be a bit quicker to learn so I will go down that path first. Then I realize that everything that has to do with front end is built upon HTML, CSS and plain vanilla JavaScript so I am going to spend as much time as needed to master these things well before going onto a framework.
Write down your decisions and plan it out. Again, if you don’t have a clue then just get this section done – you can always try something different if you decide that this path is not for you 

3)	Stick with it
Stick with it – at least 2 months. Often time the first few weeks you are going to feel like the path is not for you – remember, anything worth doing is hard to get started on. Try to get somewhat decent at the skill first before saying that it is not for you
If you still think that the path you have decided for yourself is still good after 2 months then keep going! If you are not, do not think you have wasted your time – everything that you have learned will come back to help you – pick another path and move on.

And that’s it. Don’t overthink things and just start.
