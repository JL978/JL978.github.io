Getting started is hard. Is that not true of anything? Every single day we struggle with sitting down and getting to work. We procrastinate on the important stuff because getting started on anything is uncomfortable. Why? Perhaps, because we often look into the future and realize that there are just too much to be done. Perhaps we fear that our effort will eventually be wasted so we just rather not do it at all. Or perhaps laziness is just our default mode. There are countless names for it – physicists call it inertia, author Steven Pressfield calls it resistance, some call it your ‘lower self’. Whatever it is, it prevents us from becoming a better version of ourselves. 

Anything worth doing has this weight to it that we must put enormous amount of work into to get it into motion. Why? All the tasks that has little weight to have already been done by us procrastinator in order to avoid the dreaded task of getting the important stuff started. 
So why am I talking all about this resistance? Because I am just getting started on a new path for myself. I have a dream – to become an excellent web developer. And getting started in this journey and staying on it, I realize, is going to be difficult. And so this blog is an attempt to constantly remind myself why I wanted to be on this journey in the first place. It is a place to record all my thoughts, my journey and is a reflection on what I am going to be doing. In the end, I will become an excellent developer.

The Why
I think I made a big mistake with my life 4 years ago – I decided to go University to learn materials engineering. My thoughts were that I wanted to work with cutting edge technologies and that I am going to be an inventor that changes the world with my work in nanotechnology. Well, I did not realize that cutting edge technology means countless experiments gone wrong, countless hours of manual labor because current technology has not caught up to what we are doing, and most of your effort will never see the light of day because it will never reach the market. 

I’m not trying to be negative here, in fact there are certain aspects that I enjoy about this kind of work – the initial design, the implementation of new ideas, the building of new systems, the diagnosis of problems. Fact is, I learned that I am not an inventor/discoverer but a builder/designer. I don’t have the patience to manually do things over and over with slight variations, but I enjoy building and designing systems that does the job for me. 

This trait in me was exemplify when I was working on my very first big software project – a project that forces me to learn things beyond what I am comfortable with. I had to build a desktop app from the ui, to the main functionality, to the database integration. Even though it is something extremely challenging, every single day of working on it brings me a lot of joy. The software development cycle, I realize, condenses everything I enjoy doing – system design, implementation of ideas, testing, debugging – into such a short timeframe which keep me motivated to keep going. I love it and I want to do more of it in the future.

The how 
I call this post the summer of code. Right now, I am between semesters of the school year – one that I haven’t had in the 4 years of school and internships. I believe that this is a gift to me to be able to get a head start to my starting my new journey of trying to learn web development. Therefore, I will treat this as a job and work every single day to learn as much as I can, starting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I don’t know how many eyes this post will reach - it may just ever be me who will read it and that is okay because I wrote this for myself. However, if you somehow found your way here and is just starting on your journey as well, I hope that this post and this blog as a whole help keep you keep going in the toughest of times – the beginning.
