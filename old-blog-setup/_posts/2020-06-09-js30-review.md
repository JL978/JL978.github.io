title: "Wes Bos' JS30 course review"

Three weeks ago, I signed up for a free online course called JS30 by Wes Bos. The premise of the course is that you will be doing 30 different projects – one everyday - using just plain JavaScript. In this post, I will reflect on my experience with the course and review whether the course was worth doing.

First thing first, I think the course is extremely beginner friendly. The only requirement, in my opinion, to start going through the course is just know a little bit of basic JavaScript syntax such as defining variables and functions. Anything else, the instructor Wes Bos does an extremely good job at explaining the covered material. The course comes with a starter package that comes with premade HTML and CSS files so you can focus purely on improving your JavaScript skills.

Now I was able to finish the course within about 2 weeks time. This is mainly because I have a background in programming in Python, therefore the logic side of the programming comes to me fairly easily. I was just focusing on learning the syntax and understanding how JavaScript interacted with objects in the DOM. Having foundation in programming, I was confident to go through more than one tutorial a day. However, if you are an absolute beginner don’t feel the need to rush things and go through the tutorial one by one everyday as intended. 

Even if you are not a beginner programmer, I think that it would be great practice to go through the projects and try to do them without looking at the answer. Perhaps you would also do everything from scratch instead of using the started files for even more practice with HTML and CSS. I intend to come back to these projects every now and then to see whether or not I can still do them from scratch.

In terms of content, many projects cover topics that I find is useful for bigger projects. Topics such as adding and removing items to classList to alter the css display, advanced array method, transitions, working with page positioning, setInterval are some of the most useful topics I found.  

Like I said before, if you decide on doing the course, don’t try to go too fast! Take your time in understanding everything that was covered in the videos – in tomorrow’s post, I’m going to go though the process getting the most out of every video tutorial. It is also absolutely fine to skip some of the tutorials that does not interest you so much.
